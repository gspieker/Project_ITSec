# Project Keylogger

This github page is dedicated to my Cyber Security project.

## Research proposal
This project is to research how keyloggers work and which ways they can be introduced into systems, their potential risks, and the strategies for detecting and mitigating their impact. Keyloggers are malicious software or hardware that covertly record keystrokes, posing a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and their sensitive information. By studying keyloggers, we can better understand their operation, assess their impact, and develop effective countermeasures to safeguard against them.


### Objectives
- Building and analyzing a hardware (USB) keyloggers. (George)
-- We will build Keyloggers with different libraries for Key input.
-- Analyze the way they are setup.
-- Review the code.
- Examine the potential risks associated with keyloggers. (Sabrina)
-- Confidentiality.
-- Integrity.
-- Availability.
- Examine existing detection techniques for identifying keyloggers.(Richard)
-- Examine the hash values of keyloggers and how they trigger an IDS.
-- Examine which libraries are flagged by IDS and why.
- Examine measures for mitigation. (Cedric)
-- IDS (SecOps)
-- ISMS (Security Processes)

### Methodology 
We we will build and analyze a keylogger. As well as review literature on the matter.

### Expectations
Gaining an understanding of keyloggers, their technical aspects, and their potential risks to individuals and organizations
