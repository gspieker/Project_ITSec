# Project Keylogger

This github page is dedicated to my Cyber Security project.

## Research proposal

This project is to research how keyloggers work and which ways they can be introduced into systems, their potential risks, and the strategies for detecting and mitigating their impact. Keyloggers are malicious software or hardware that covertly record keystrokes, posing a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and their sensitive information. By studying keyloggers, we can better understand their operation, assess their impact, and develop effective countermeasures to safeguard against them.
